  - [ ] Gemini AI API key
  - [ ] Cloudinary credentials
  - [ ] Frontend URL (your domain)
  - [ ] Rate limiting settings

#### 2. DNS and Domain
- [ ] Purchase and configure domain name
- [ ] Set up DNS records (A records pointing to EC2 IP)
- [ ] Consider using AWS Route 53 for DNS management

#### 3. External Services
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas production cluster
- [ ] Configure Cloudinary for production
- [ ] Obtain Google AI API key
- [ ] Set up any additional third-party services

#### 4. AWS Configuration
- [ ] Create EC2 instance with appropriate size
- [ ] Configure security groups
- [ ] Set up Elastic IP (recommended)
- [ ] Configure IAM roles if using AWS services
- [ ] Consider setting up Application Load Balancer

#### 5. Security

- [ ] Enable CloudTrail and GuardDuty

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Quick PM2 Deployment
```bash
# On your EC2 instance
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/torch-fellowship-backend/main/deploy/deploy-ec2.sh
chmod +x deploy-ec2.sh
./deploy-ec2.sh https://github.com/your-username/torch-fellowship-backend.git your-domain.com
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# On your EC2 instance
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/torch-fellowship-backend/main/deploy/deploy-docker-ec2.sh
chmod +x deploy-docker-ec2.sh
./deploy-docker-ec2.sh https://github.com/your-username/torch-fellowship-backend.git your-domain.com
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
Follow the detailed steps in `EC2-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`

## ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Validation

### Health Checks
- [ ] Basic health: `curl https://your-domain.com/health`
- [ ] Detailed health: `curl https://your-domain.com/health/detailed`
- [ ] API endpoints: Test core functionality
- [ ] Socket.IO: Verify real-time features
- [ ] SSL certificate: Verify HTTPS works

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing with expected traffic
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Response time validation
- [ ] Database performance

### Security Validation

- [ ] Security headers check
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Access controls verification

## ðŸ›  Maintenance and Monitoring

### Regular Tasks
- **Daily**: Monitor health checks and logs
- **Weekly**: Review security logs and update system
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and review performance
- **Quarterly**: Full security audit and disaster recovery test

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Track application metrics

## ðŸ”„ Update Process

### Regular Updates
```bash
